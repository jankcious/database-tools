What hospitals are models of high-quality care?  That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.   

To determine an overall score for each hospital, the average score for each procedure was calculated.  The resulting average measure scores were used to index each hospital's performance
against the average.  The average index was then calculated for each hospital.
Values of "Not Available" were excluded from this evaulation along with measures of Emergency Room volume (since it is categorical and cannot be averaged).

Below are the top 10 averages for hospitals:
ZUNI COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER      203.68947612993597
PERHAM HEALTH   193.85471901283168

STARR COUNTY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL  168.50809304839314
BROWNFIELD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER      165.5480566683895

PROVIDENT HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO   158.59134746357236
EASTERN OKLAHOMA MEDICAL CENTER 156.67861423244338

This method of indexing was used in order to control for the very different types of procedures.  If a hospital scores 99 on a measure, it matters more whether this is an outlier or a completely normal value.
If every hospital scores 99, then the score is unremarkable.  This also has the benefit of allowing us to compare scores with different scales.
